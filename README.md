# EncryptionDecryption
# Overview
This project provides a Python implementation for encrypting and decrypting text using a symmetric key. It also includes functionality to reset the encryption key. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic cryptographic operations in Python and to provide a simple interface for secure data handling.
# Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

<b>Secure Data Transmission:</b> To develop a system that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text data, ensuring the confidentiality of the information during transmission or storage.<br>
<b>Ease of Use:</b> To create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables users, even with minimal technical knowledge, to perform encryption and decryption operations easily.<br>
<b>Key Management:</b> To implement a robust key management system that allows secure generation, storage, and resetting of encryption keys.<br>
<b>Educational Purpose:</b> To serve as a learning tool for understanding the fundamental concepts of cryptography, including encryption, decryption, and key management.<br>
<b>Practical Application:</b> To provide a practical tool that can be used for personal or organizational purposes to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.<br>
<b>Compliance and Security:</b> To follow industry standards and best practices for cryptographic operations, ensuring the developed system is secure and reliable.<br>
# Features
<b>Encryption:</b> Encrypts plain text using a symmetric key.<br>
<b>Decryption:</b> Decrypts cipher text back to plain text using the same key.<br>
<b>Key Reset:</b> Allows the user to reset the encryption key.<br>
# Scope
<b>Symmetric Key Encryption:</b> Implementation of symmetric key encryption techniques where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.<br>
<b>Key Management:</b> Providing functionality for generating, storing, and resetting encryption keys securely.<br>
<b>Text Data Handling:</b> Focusing on encryption and decryption of plain text data, which can be extended to other data types.<br>
<b>User Interface:</b> Creating a simple command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for users to perform encryption, decryption, and key management operations.<br>
<b>Security Best Practices:</b> Ensuring the implementation follows best practices for cryptographic operations to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.<br>
<b>Extensibility:</b> Designing the system in a modular way to allow future extensions, such as supporting asymmetric encryption, file encryption, or integration with databases and web services.<br>
<b>Documentation and Testing:</b> Providing comprehensive documentation and unit tests to ensure the reliability and usability of the encryption and decryption functions.<br>
